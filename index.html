                    <h2>What is Management?</h2>
                    <p>Management can be defined as the process carried out to achieve the goals of the organization by planning, organizing, leading, and controlling resources. It is essential not only for business concerns but also for banks, schools, colleges, hospitals, and other institutions.</p>
                    <blockquote><strong>Peter F. Drucker:</strong> "Management is an organ; organs can be described and defined only through their functions."</blockquote>
                    <blockquote><strong>Henry Fayol:</strong> "To manage is to forecast and plan, to organize, to compound, to co-ordinate and to control."</blockquote>
                    <h2>Nature of Management</h2>
                    <p>Management is a multifaceted concept, viewed as a science, an art, and a profession.</p>
                    <h4>Management as a Science</h4><p>It's considered a social science because it has a systematized body of knowledge and uses scientific methods of observation and experimentation (pioneered by F.W. Taylor). However, it's not an exact science as it deals with unpredictable human behavior.</p>
                    <h4>Management as an Art</h4><p>It's an art because it requires creativity, personal skills, and practical application to solve real-world problems and adapt learned principles to specific situations.</p>
                    <h4>Management as a Profession</h4><p>Management is evolving into a profession with a specialized body of knowledge, formal education, a code of conduct, and a service motive. The separation of ownership and management in modern corporations has professionalized the manager's role.</p>`

                    <h2>Management vs. Administration</h2>
                    <p>There are varying viewpoints on the relationship between management and administration. In 1923, Oliver Sheldon first distinguished between the two.</p>
                    <h4>1. Administration is Beyond Management</h4><p>This view holds that administration is a higher-level function, primarily concerned with policy formulation and decision-making, while management is concerned with the execution of those policies.</p>
                    <h4>2. Administration is a Unit of Management</h4><p>This approach sees management as a broader term that includes administrative functions. Here, administration handles routine, periodic tasks while management focuses on policy creation.</p>
                    <h4>3. Administration and Management are Equivalent</h4><p>The most common modern view, supported by thinkers like Henri Fayol, is that there is no significant difference between the two. Both involve similar functions, processes, and principles aimed at achieving organizational goals.</p>`

                    <p>Managerial positions are typically divided into three levels, forming a hierarchy of command and authority.</p>
                    <h3>1. Top Level (Administrative Level)</h3><p>Consists of the Board of Directors, CEO, or Managing Director. They are the ultimate source of authority.</p><ul><li>Set objectives and broad policies.</li><li>Prepare strategic plans & policies.</li><li>Appoint middle-level managers.</li><li>Control and coordinate all departments.</li></ul>

They are responsible to top management for their department's functioning.</p><ul><li>Execute plans from top management.</li><li>Make plans for their sub-units.</li><li>Participate in employment and training of lower-level management.</li><li>Interpret and explain policies to lower levels.</li></ul>
                    <h3>3. Lower Level (Supervisory / Operative Level)</h3><p>Consists of supervisors and foremen. They are directly involved with the workforce.</p><ul><li>Assign jobs and tasks to workers.</li><li>Guide and instruct workers daily.</li><li>Responsible for the quality and quantity of production.</li><li>Solve worker grievances and maintain discipline.</li></ul>`

                    <h2>Evolution of Management Thought: Classical Theory</h2>
                    <p>The classical approach (or traditional approach) focused on the anatomy of the formal organization for greater efficiency. It emphasized division of labor, specialization, and structure. It has three main streams:</p>
                    <h3>A1. Bureaucracy (Max Weber)</h3><p>Max Weber described an ideal type of organization called a <strong>bureaucracy</strong>. He saw it as a formal system of organization based on clearly defined hierarchical levels and roles, detailed rules and regulations, and impersonal relationships. Key elements include:</p><ul><li><strong>Division of Labor:</strong> Jobs are broken down into simple, routine, and well-defined tasks.</li><li><strong>Authority Hierarchy:</strong> Positions are organized in a hierarchy with a clear chain of command.</li><li><strong>Formal Selection:</strong> People are selected for jobs based on technical qualifications.</li><li><strong>Formal Rules & Regulations:</strong> A system of written rules and standard operating procedures.</li><li><strong>Impersonality:</strong> Uniform application of rules and controls, not according to personalities.</li><li><strong>Career Orientation:</strong> Managers are career professionals, not owners of the units they manage.</li></ul>
                    <h3>A2. Scientific Management (F.W. Taylor)</h3><p>Frederick W. Taylor, the 'father of scientific management', applied scientific methods to management to increase labor efficiency. He believed worker output was only about one-third of what was possible.</p><h4>Taylor's 4 Principles:</h4><ol><li><strong>Scientific Job Analysis:</strong> Replace rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks.</li><li><strong>Selection of Personnel:</strong> Scientifically select, train, and develop each worker.</li><li><strong>Management Cooperation:</strong> Cooperate with workers to ensure scientifically developed methods are followed.</li><li><strong>Functional Supervising:</strong> Divide work nearly equally between managers (planning) and workers (performing tasks).</li></ol>
                    <h3>A3. Process Management (Henri Fayol)</h3><p>This approach, associated with Henri Fayol, focuses on the management process. It involves aligning processes with strategic goals, designing process architectures, and establishing measurement systems. Fayol's work laid the foundation for the functions of management.</p>`

                    <h2>Evolution of Management Thought: Neoclassical Theory</h2>
                    <p>The neoclassical approach emerged as a reaction to the classical theories, arguing that they didn't fully achieve workplace harmony because they ignored the 'people side' of the organization.</p>
                    <h3>B1. Human Relations Approach (Elton Mayo)</h3><p>Elton Mayo is considered the father of this school of thought, which grew out of the famous <strong>Hawthorne Studies</strong>. This approach revealed the importance of social and psychological factors in determining worker productivity and satisfaction.</p><h4>Key Propositions:</h4><ul><li>The business organization is a social system, not just a techno-economic system.</li><li>Employees have social and psychological needs, not just economic ones.</li><li>The informal group is a major influence on the behavior of its members.</li><li>Employee-oriented, democratic, and participative management is more effective.</li></ul>
                    <h3>B2. Behavioural Science Approach (McGregor, Maslow)</h3><p>An extension and refinement of the human relations approach, this uses concepts from psychology, sociology, and anthropology to understand human behavior at work.</p><h4>Key Contributions:</h4><ul><li><strong>Douglas McGregor's Theory X and Y:</strong> Theory X assumes workers are lazy and need to be forced, while Theory Y assumes workers are self-motivated and enjoy work.</li><li><strong>Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:</strong> Proposes that humans are motivated by a hierarchy of needs, from basic physiological needs to higher-level self-actualization needs.</li></ul>`
